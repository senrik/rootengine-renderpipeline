# Render Pipeline
## Principles
The Render Pipeline (RP) should be a lightweight, fast module. To facilitate this it is written in C with the _procedural programming_ paradigm.

The RP will be a series of operations performed on the data that is fed into it from the rest of the engine. It will keep a cache of objects that will be rendered.
